                Registry policies “… with Expert Review”
          draft-bormann-gendispatch-with-expert-review-latest

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 8126, adding registry policies that augment
   an existing policy that is based on a review body action with the
   additional requirement for a Designated Expert review.

   It also updates RFC 7120 with the necessary process to perform early
   allocations for registries with one of the augmented policies.

1.  Introduction

   Section 4 of RFC 8126 [BCP26] defines a number of _well-known
   policies_ that can be referenced as registration policies from
   documents that set up IANA registries.  Some of these policies
   involve a _Designated Expert_, who is intended to be aware of the
   fine points of what should or should not become a registration in
   that registry (Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of RFC 8126 [BCP26]).  Some other

Internet-Draft  Registry policies “… with Expert Review”      April 2024


   policies involve a _review body_ that autonomously, not involving a
   _Designated Expert_, decide whether a registration should be accepted
   (Sections 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, and 4.10 of RFC 8126 [BCP26]).

   In the past, this has occasionally led to friction where a Designated
   Expert was not consulted by the review body before approving the
   registration, missing some finer point (such as certain consistency
   requirements) that would have been pointed out by the expert.

   This document updates Section 4 of RFC 8126 [BCP26], adding registry
   policies that augment an existing policy that is based on a review
   body action with the additional requirement for a Designated Expert
   review.

   It also updates Sections 2 and 3 of RFC 7120 [BCP100] with the
   necessary process to perform early allocations for registries with
   one of the augmented policies.

2.  Augmented Registration Policies

   For each of the well-known policies defined in Sections 4.7, 4.8,
   4.9, and 4.10 of RFC 8126 [BCP26], this document adds a parallel
   _augmented policy_ that also specifies involving a Designated Expert.

2.1.  RFC Required With Expert Review

   This policy is identical to a combination of Sections 4.6 and 4.7 of
   RFC 8126 [BCP26].  The RFC to be published serves as the
   documentation required by Section 4.6 of RFC 8126 [BCP26].  It is the
   responsibility of the stream approving body (see Section 5.1 of
   [RFC8729]) to ensure that an approval for the registration by the
   Designated Expert is obtained before approving the RFC establishing
   the registration.

2.2.  IETF Review With Expert Review

   This policy is identical to a combination of Sections 4.6 and 4.8 of
   RFC 8126 [BCP26].  The RFC to be published serves as the
   documentation required by Section 4.6 of RFC 8126 [BCP26].  It is the
   responsibility of the IESG to ensure that an approval for the
   registration by the Designated Expert is obtained before approving
   the RFC establishing the registration.

2.3.  Standards Action With Expert Review

   This policy is identical to a combination of Sections 4.6 and 4.9 of
   RFC 8126 [BCP26], mirroring the requirements of Section 2.2 narrowed
   down to a certain type of RFC to be published.

Internet-Draft  Registry policies “… with Expert Review”      April 2024


2.4.  IESG Approval With Expert Review

   This policy is identical to a combination of either Section 4.5 or
   Section 4.6 with Section 4.10 of RFC 8126 [BCP26], depending on the
   discretion of the IESG mentioned in the first paragraph of the latter
   section (which may be additionally informed by input from the
   Designated Expert).  It is the responsibility of the IESG to ensure
   that an approval for the registration by the Designated Expert is
   obtained before approving the registration.

3.  Early Allocation for Augmented Registration Policies

   This document updates RFC 7120 [BCP100] to apply to the augmented
   policies defined above in Section 2.1, Section 2.2, and Section 2.3.

   Specifically:

   *  Item (a) in Section 2 of RFC 7120 [BCP100] is extended to include
      the three augmented policies.

   *  Item (2) in Section 3.1 of RFC 7120 [BCP100] is amended as
      follows:

   |  2.  The WG chairs determine whether the conditions for early
   |      allocations described in Section 2 are met, particularly
   |      conditions (c) and (d).  For the registration policies defined
   |      in Section 2 of RFC-XXXX, the WG chairs first request review
   |      and approval from the Designated Expert.


   // RFC editor: please replace XXXX by the RFC number of this document
   // and delete this note.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of Section 5 of RFC 7120 [BCP100] and
   Section 12 of RFC 8126 [BCP26] apply.  Augmenting registration
   policies by Designated Expert involvement may help reduce the
   potential of introducing security issues by adding inconsistent or
   insecure registrations to a registry.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document is all about procedures that need to be implemented by
   IANA, but by itself has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Usage in Existing Specifications

   This appendix is informative.

   Examples for RFCs (and one RFC-to-be) and registries created from
   them that use "Standards Action with Expert Review", without further
   explanation of this usage, include:

   *  [IANA.uuid], interpreting the approved
      [I-D.ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis-14]

   *  [IANA.cose], interpreting Section 11 of [RFC9052] in conjunction
      with the older Section 16 of [RFC8152]

   *  [IANA.ace], interpreting Section 9 of [RFC9203]

   *  Section 6 of [RFC9393]

   *  Section 10 of [RFC9528]

A.1.  Related Policy Statements Potentially of Interest

   In a number of places, [RFC8881] uses phrasing such as:

   |  Hence, all assignments to the registry are made on a Standards
   |  Action basis per Section 4.6 of [63], with Expert Review required.

   (here, [63] is a reference to RFC 8126 [BCP100].  RFC 8881's
   predecessor [RFC5661] used:)

   |  All assignments to the registry are made on a Standards Action
   |  basis per Section 4.1 of [55], with Expert Review required.

   (here, [55] is a reference to [RFC5226], the precursor of RFC 8126,
   which listed the well-known policies in its Section 4.1.)

   [RFC4430] (written before [RFC5226]) uses this phrasing:

   |  *  Assignment from the "RESERVED TO IANA" range needs Standards
   |     Action, or non-standards-track RFCs with Expert Review.

Internet-Draft  Registry policies “… with Expert Review”      April 2024


   Somewhat unrelated, [RFC6787] uses the redundant phrase
   "Specification Required with Expert Review".  Section 5 of [RFC5797]
   uses related phrasing for a more complicated requirement.

Acknowledgments

   The creation of this document was prompted by an IESG ballot comment
   from John Scudder, which led to the observation that the now somewhat
   common practice of augmenting review-body-based registry policies by
   Expert Review had not been documented sufficiently.
